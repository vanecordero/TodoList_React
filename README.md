# TO-DO List

Basically it is a To-do list that should allow the user to create task, delete and complete. To take it to the next level I have also added different categories for the tasks (work, academic, personal, health, etc) and use graphs to show the progress of the tasks.

### Requirements:
- Create, delete and complete tasks.
- Show taks.
- Search task.
- Organize by different categories
- Save and get the tasks in local storage.
- Use charts to show progress.

### TS Stack
- React
- React-chartjs-2
- BEM
